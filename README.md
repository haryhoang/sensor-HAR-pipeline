> **Automated Feature Extraction Pipeline for Wearable Fall Detection Systems.**

## 📖 Introduction

In wearable AIoT applications, raw sensor data is noisy and high-dimensional. Feeding raw data directly into Machine Learning models often leads to poor performance and high latency on edge devices (ESP32/Jetson Nano).

This repository provides a robust **ETL Pipeline** designed to transform raw accelerometer/gyroscope data into meaningful statistical features, optimized for **Fall Detection Models**.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡ Automated Sliding Window:** Converts continuous time-series data into structured instances (e.g., 50 samples/window).
*   **🧮 Advanced Feature Engineering:** Automatically extracts critical features for HAR (Human Activity Recognition):
    *   **Statistical:** Mean, Max, Min, Standard Deviation.
    *   **Higher-Order Stats:** Kurtosis (Peakedness), Skewness (Asymmetry).
    *   **Physics-based:** Signal Magnitude Vector (SVM), Jerk (Derivative of Acceleration).
*   **📊 Visualization Tools:** Built-in plotting modules to visualize signal spikes during Fall events vs. ADL (Activities of Daily Living).

## 📸 Visualization Showcase

One of the key challenges is distinguishing a **Fall** from a **Sit-down** action.
As shown below, the pipeline extracts specific signal signatures:

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Download the **WEDA Dataset** from the official source.
    *   Place the csv file into `data/raw/` folder.
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2.  **Run the Pipeline:**
    Execute the python script to process data:
    ```bash
    python src/pipeline.py
    ```

3.  **Result:**
    The clean dataset with extracted features will be saved at `data/processed/wada_features.csv`.
